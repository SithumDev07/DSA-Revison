## Abstract Data Structure - ADT - Behavior of the structure is.

### Sorting

#### Bubble Sort

    Bubble sort is the simplest technique in which we compare every element with its adjacent element and swap the elements if they are not in order. This way at the end of every iteration (called a pass), the heaviest element gets bubbled up at the end of the list.


### Searching

#### Linear Search

    In linear search the array order is doesn't matter. The time complexity is O(n).

#### Binary Search

    In binary search when the size of array is increased by twice, the steps are only increasing by one. The time complexity is O(log n).
